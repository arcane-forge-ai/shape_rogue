# Circle Rouge - Patch Notes v1.4.0
## "Audio-Visual Overhaul" - Polish & Immersion Update

**Release Date:** May 29, 2025

---

## 📋 **CURRENT FEEDBACK LIST**

### **Fixed This Update ✅**
- ~~Hero shapes should be matching with their names~~ → **FIXED:** Hero selection menu now displays proper shapes without square overlays
- ~~Background needs visual enhancement~~ → **FIXED:** Added beautiful battlefield background image
- ~~Game needs audio feedback~~ → **FIXED:** Comprehensive audio system with BGM and sound effects

### **Remaining Issues**
- Need a visual effect for hex's ability. Right now you have no way to tell if it's working.
- Show cooldown seconds on the cooldown bar 
- Instead of having a uniformed decrease of spawn interval, change it to have `spawn_interval` and `spawn_count` configs for each wave. `spawn_count` means how many spawns we would have for each spawn
- `shooter` should not move towards the hero by default.
