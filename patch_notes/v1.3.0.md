# Circle Rouge - Patch Notes v1.3.0
## "Heroes Unleashed" - Major Content Update

**Release Date:** [Current Date]

---

## üìã **CURRENT FEEDBACK LIST**

### **Bugs**
- Hero shapes should be matching with their names
- Need a visual effect for hex's ability. Right now you have no way to tell if it's working.

### **Improvements**
- Show cooldown seconds on the cooldown bar 
- Instead of having a uniformed decrease of spawn interval, change it to have `spawn_interval` and `spawn_count` configs for each wave. `spawn_count` means how many spawns we would have for each spawn
- `shooter` should not move towards the hero by default.
