I didn't see any. and I can't scroll to the right on desktop during the selection screen. Otherwise, I want a bit more complexity (enemy types, weapon types, upgrade types), game mode (endless vs staged vs 1hp), and meta game for replayability (upgrades that I can carry between games. Also, a slower ramp in difficulty would be better",

        "feedback": "I have a neutral feeling about the shape themes. I feel shapes make the game feel more like a POC. I think something like a bacterial theme would be cool. It's similar to the shape theme with different circles as different cells or antibodies and the enemies could be different types of bacteria or viruses."
